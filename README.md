This is just for the folks in the https://old.reddit.com/r/openscad/comments/1hyjahg/retired_programmer_who_cant_design_for_squat_oh/ thread.

It was getting too tough to talk in the abstract without sufficient context.

The front-end of this is, as you might imagine, "main.scad"

At this stage there's still a lot of dead code in here, for which I must apologize.  But I figured "getting it all happy nice nice" would just be a delaying tactic, fooling no one.

An important note: The code's messy, sure.  But this isn't a "code's messy but it works."  It ALmost works.  

- screw holes on bottom plate are offset by about 2 mil (all in the same direction, oddly.
- I really don't love the screw posts inside.  I want them to blend with the walls.  But they're perfectly functional for now.
- For reasons I'm exploring right now, the "top" (speaker panel face) is of double thickness, so the "cutout" doesn't cut out, just forces support generation.

I hate the way this code looks and my "real" code really is much cleaner.  But it's my first openSCAD project and I'd rather have a messy workspace as I work things out than spend too much time mopping the wrong things up.
